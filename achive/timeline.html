                Below is a bref timeline detailing each year during my PhD and the major milestones. First, I have also listed the conferences and summer schools I attended and in what capacity I contributed to their proceedings.

            <p>
                Thesis year! Anticipating much writing and little adventuring. No conferences planed as yet. This is how I started the year, not the same spirit that I ended it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">2016 - 2017</h2>
            <p>
            Busy year with many changes and plenty of conference trips.
            </p>
            <p>
                The year started with the most adventurous and far flung conference of my PhD. Auckland, New Zealand
                is pretty much as for as you can go from Birmingham to do physics, well maybe Hawaii is further. The
                conference was the IAU's 329th symposium entitled "The Lives and Death Throes of Massive Stars".
            </p>
            <p>
                The second trip of the year was to St Andrews again. This time to attend the UK exoplanet community meeting.
                This conference was my second opportunity to present a talk and the first in which I was presenting a topic
                that I'd become confident with.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the third trip of the year, a visit to the Leibniz Institute in Potsdam. Presenting the same results as
                I did earlier in the year at St Andrews, the talk went well and was a definite improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The forth trip was back to St Andrews but not for a conference or summer school this the, but to visit some
                colleagues to talk about possible collaborations.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">2015 - 2016</h2>
            <p>
                One of the
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">2014 - 2015</h2>
            <p>
                During the first year of my PhD I attended the Royal Astronomical Societies (RAS) National Astronomy Meeting (NAM). This was held in Llandudno, north wales. This trip proved remarkable in several ways. First is was quick, attending for one day, which was merciful as is was mind numbingly boaring. Second, it was my first conference talk and also my worst. Looking back, in the years after this trip, I know that my talk was inappropreate for the session and that it is always important to be "picky" about what conference one goes to, earing on the side of "hyper-specific" to my field, or that maximises travel to exotic places. Finally, it was later descuvered this was the first time me and my future wife were in the same room, though we didn't and my  wife remembers nothin of my talk, which I think is the only non-remarkable aspect of that sorty, as I wish I didn't..
            </p>
            <p>
                I also attended a summer school in St Andrews on the topic of Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT).
