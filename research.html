            <p>
                Modern super-computers represent a vast potential tool for testing our understanding of the physical world. They also present a challanging technical problem. Computer programs writting to to executed on these machines need to be efficient, scalable, flexible and at the same time user friendly, extendable and
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many buzz-words used when describing the goal of such programs, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exascale_computing">Exascale</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_parallel">Massively parallel</a>, but what these essenitally describe is a codes ability to run utilising a large number of threads while at the same time retaining efficient execution, otherwise known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability">scalability</a>. This is most commonly achived by designing a code with a hybrid-parallisation scheme. This effectievely attempts to reduce the volume of communications between the distributed memory locations throughout a super-computer by directing the majority of the communications via the shared memory within a node. Today there exists multiple frameworks for achieving the above goal. My work only makes use of one, the <a href="https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos">the Kokkos framework</a>.

Each simulation snapshot is 5.2 TB of data. This scale of numerical simulation and data output is not possible without high performace frameworks such as <a href="https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos">Kokkos</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">Big Data</a> managment methods.

                  Throughout their lifetimes, stars and their planets form a closely bound, highly evolving system driven by a large range of simultaneous physical processes. The aim of my research so far has been to understand the role magnetic fields play in shaping the environment around stars and planets, in order to understand how stars form connections with their planets, the interstellar medium (ISM) and each other.
              </p>
              <span class="image right"><img src="images/spi/volume2.png" alt="" /></span>
              <p>
                  Magnetic fields are an innate property of stellar and planetary bodies on all length scales, from small surface features to extended winds. The question of what fundamental role magnetic fields play in shaping the environment around stars and planet is central to understanding stellar and planetary formation and evolution, as well as properties of large scale structures such as the ISM, star clusters and beyond.
              </p>
                  My work to date has been concerned with the winds and environment of main sequence stars, and end of life Jupiter-type exoplanets. Using simulations as numerical experiments, I am able to predict observational signatures of stellar and planetary (co)evolution models to support current and future observational campaigns.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Radio emission from stars and planets is an extremely powerful diagnostic tool for testing theoretical models. Thermal emission due to hot plasma and cyclotron emission from magnetically confined electrons occur in many stellar and planetary phenomena. From my simulation results, I predict radio fluxes to directly test my models against observation.

							<h2 class="content-subhead">Winds from Massive Stars</h2>
              <p>
                  Large stars with masses typically above 5 solar masses have winds driven by the intence radiation they produce. As massive stars can be 10,000s of times more luminus than the Sun, these winds can reach velocities in the region of 3000 km/s.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The images above show both direct observations of star forming regions and results form my simulation of these objects. Centrasl is the role of the star's magnetic field, which controles the topology of the expanding stellar wind. This impact can be observed at radio wave lengths, providing insight into the dynamic enviroment close to the stellar surface.
              </p>

                  Closer to home, solar like stars (meaning stars like our sun), which host planets slimilar to thoes found in our solar system are.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Below are links to videos of MHD simulations of a solar types star with an orbiting planetary body comparable to that of Jupiter. Both the star and planet are magnetised with dipole fields of 1 G. The winds of both the star and planet are initialised according to Parkers wind model.
