            <h2 class="content-subhead">2017 - 2018</h2>
            <p>
            Thesis year! Anticipating much writing and little adventuring. No conferences planed as yet.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">2016 - 2017</h2>
            <p>
            Busy year with many changes and plenty of conference trips.
            </p>
            <p>
            The year started with the most adventurous and far flung conference of my PhD. Auckland, New Zealand
            is pretty much as for as you can go from Birmingham to do physics, well maybe Hawaii is further. The
            conference was the IAU's 329th symposium entitled "The Lives and Death Throes of Massive Stars".
            </p>
            <p>
            The second trip of the year was to St Andrews again. This time to attend the UK exoplanet community meeting.
            This conference was my second opportunity to present a talk and the first in which I was presenting a topic
            that I'd become confident with.
            </p>
            <p>
            For the third trip of the year, a visit to the Leibniz Institute in Potsdam. Presenting the same results as
            I did earlier in the year at St Andrews, the talk went well and was a definite improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
            The forth trip was back to St Andrews but not for a conference or summer school this the, but to visit some
            colleagues to talk about possible collaborations.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">2015 - 2016</h2>
            <p>
            One of the
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">2014 - 2015</h2>
            <p>
            During the first year of my PhD I attended the Royal Astronomical Societies (RAS) National Astronomy Meeting (NAM).
            </p>
            <p>
            I also attended a summer school in St Andrews on the topic of Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT).
